Starting a new basic web testing framework project\
It will grow as I learn more\
These will be javascript based project that uses selenium for browser automation and plain old js for everything else.\
My next goal is to create a professional looking project sturcture.\

Ok so I ran the oriject and it is failing. So I gotta try some fixes tomorrow. ðŸ˜’
